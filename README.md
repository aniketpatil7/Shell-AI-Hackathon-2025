# Fuel Blend Properties Predictor üõ¢Ô∏è

**Shell.ai Hackathon ‚Äì Ranked Top 20**  
Predicting fuel blend properties using advanced machine learning techniques.

---

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting multiple fuel blend properties from a dataset containing 55 input features. Leveraging a combination of regression models, feature engineering, and ensemble learning, we developed a highly accurate predictive pipeline for the Shell.ai Hackathon.

## Key Features & Highlights

- **Team Collaboration:** Worked in a multidisciplinary team of 4 members, submitting 100+ iterative machine learning models to refine predictions.
- **Regression Pipeline:** Built a multivariate regression pipeline using `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, and `LightGBM` to predict 10 blend properties with **94.2% accuracy**.
- **Feature Engineering & Cross-Validation:** Engineered 15+ specialized features and applied 5-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
- **Stacked Ensemble Learning:** Developed 10 specialized models and meta-regressors for individual blend properties, improving precision and reducing prediction errors.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Conducted 20k+ trials using `Optuna` and `GridSearchCV` for model tuning, combined with systematic error analysis.
- **Performance Metric:** Reduced Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 12% through iterative optimization and model stacking.
